# My Work

1) **[MaskDepthGenerator](https://github.com/genigarus/MaskDepthGenerator)** takes an image and its background as input to generate depth and mask for the image. 

2) **[DepthMaskDataset](https://github.com/genigarus/DepthMaskDataset)** is a dataset of 4 lakh images with their corresponding depth and masks.

3) **[API](https://github.com/genigarus/API)** contains Pytorch functionalities for Deep Learning.

4) **[YOLOv3](https://github.com/genigarus/YoloV3)** contains training and detection Yolo v3 on custom dataset.

5) **[EVA4](https://github.com/genigarus/EVA4)** contains all the work related to EVA 4 Phase 1.

6) **[Chatbot on Bambi Dataset](https://github.com/genigarus/NLP/blob/master/ChatBot.ipynb)**

• This chatbot uses End-to-end memory network to answer question on Bambi dataset with a 
training accuracy of 90.22%. The network was created concatenating a series of embedding 
layers and dropout and passing it to an LSTM. This model is based on the reference paper: 
End-to-end memory networks.

• Language – Python, Libraries - Keras

**[MLExploration](https://github.com/genigarus/MLExploration)**

**[FalseColoring](https://github.com/genigarus/FalseColoring)** contains code to generate lines within retina.

**[CMS](https://github.com/genigarus/CMS)** - The Online College Management website is useful for the students,staff,parents who like to display result as well attendance and all the tasks like event,news,fresh assignment without going to college. It provides the facility to the students or parents to have complete information about the college.

**[ONPS](https://github.com/genigarus/ONPS)** - A J2EE based project on automating the polling system in India.

**[PyMaryo](https://github.com/genigarus/PyMaryo)** - Simplified version of Maryo game in python.
