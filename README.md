1) **[MaskDepthGenerator](https://github.com/genigarus/MaskDepthGenerator)** takes an image and its background as input to generate depth and mask for the image. 

2) **[DepthMaskDataset](https://github.com/genigarus/DepthMaskDataset)** is a dataset of 4 lakh images with their corresponding depth and masks.

3) **[API](https://github.com/genigarus/API)**

4) **[YOLOv3](https://github.com/genigarus/YoloV3)**

5) **[EVA4](https://github.com/genigarus/EVA4)**

6) **[Chatbot on Bambi Dataset](https://github.com/genigarus/NLP/blob/master/ChatBot.ipynb)**

• This chatbot uses End-to-end memory network to answer question on Bambi dataset with a 
training accuracy of 90.22%. The network was created concatenating a series of embedding 
layers and dropout and passing it to an LSTM. This model is based on the reference paper: 
End-to-end memory networks.

• Language – Python, Libraries - Keras
